        Hi there, my name is Vince Carreon Millora, a guy from the Philippines. I am a software developer that enjoys coding
        and solving complex problems. I have experiences in using different technologies; I've been a back-end developer designing databases and APIs, a Blockchain developer 
        creating Smart Contracts, and a front-end engineer designing and creating web and mobile systems. In every position I've been, and every tasks I had, I've always aimed
        for a good result that would not only satisfy myself, but also the team and the client. I'm a teamplayer that is always ready to assist my teammates when they are in need. 
        That's why one of my goal as a developer is to become a Full-Stack, so that I will be able to produce good results and assist my team even if the task is back-end or front-end. <br/><br/>
        
        Currently, I am studying the Japanese language at <a @click="openLink('http://bit-okutama.jp/')">Bridge Institute of Technology</a> to efficiently deliver my thoughts and solutions even while staying in Japan. 
        In the morning, I study Japanese by developing an I.T. project and during the end of the school's semester, I present my project using Japanese. In the afternoon, 
        I am a Web Developer of <a @click="openLink('https://jellyfish-g.co.jp/en/')">株式会社JELLYFISH</a>. <br/><br/>
        
        As a junior developer, I'm always open for new opportunities that will enhance my current skills. I hope I could interest you in some way or another. 
        You can checkout my resume here just in case.
